Data Mining Project Repository (Dikshak Khanna, Revanth Posina, Saurabh Dete)


Our suggested approach makes use of Cardiovascular dataset to predict the chances of a patient getting heart attack based on the symptoms they are having.
During the data pretreatment stage, all databases are cleaned to remove any potential noise and unusable outliers, then converted and integrated depending on attributes character. The feature extractor extracts and generates handmade attributes that are intended to describe the character and carry the value of that respective part of the data. The goal of adaptive filtering modules is to improve accurate channels by assessing the important attributes and removing any unnecessary characteristics that does not add anymore meaning or value to the present information. Finally, we use the selected criteria to build a predictive model, to predict the patientâ€™s result based on the symptoms they have reported.

<strong>We have developed a website to take the input for the model in realtime. Now model is be able to classify the input data points into the class it belongs to and then the result is shown in the last page of the website

Here is the flow of the user-interractive website for our project </strong>
